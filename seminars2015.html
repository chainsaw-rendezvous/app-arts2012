<h2>15th Annual Ridgway Chainsaw Carver's Rendezvous</h2>
<h3>Monday February 23</h3>
<p><b>"Chainsaw 101" with <strong>Tim Klock, Altoona, PA</strong></b></p>
<p><img src="images/1_Klock.jpg" width="300" height="238" style="float: left;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;" />Tim Klock began carving in 2003 after nearly destroying his ankle in a  timber framing accident.&nbsp; During the&nbsp;long recovery he started carving  with a chainsaw to keep from going crazy.&nbsp; Four months after carving his  first bear, he was invited to demonstrate his art at Blair County's Keystone  Country fair. Three years later, he was competing in the Echo Cup Championship  in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.&nbsp; He has also competed in the U.K. at the English  open and carved in Carrbridge, Scotland since 2011.  Tim is looking forward to another trip across  the pond this year.</p>
<p>When he's not traveling and competing he can be found at his studio in  Altoona, PA doing commission work and occasionally giving lessons to help other  artists achieve their dreams and goals.   He has been attending the Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous in Ridgeway since  2004.  Tim accredits half of his  knowledge on carving to the ‘Vous and the carvers that attend the event.</p>

<h3>Tuesday February 24</h3>
<p><b>"<strong>Beyond  tools and techniques</strong>" with </b> <strong>Jeff  Mohr, Oxford, WI</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/3_Mohr.jpg" width="200" height="355" style="float: left;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;" />Jeff Mohr is a gifted  artist that has been following an inner voice his entire life. It was not  always the popular choice, but it has served him well. Jeff is inspired by many  other carvers, and artists, in many different mediums.  Recognized internationally by his peers as a  Master Power Sculptor, he is a 25 year veteran of the industry and a world  class competitive Carver.&nbsp; Jeff has an impressive arsenal of tips, tricks,  and tools that have aided in his success, as well as extremely impressive  portfolio.</p>
<p> Mr. Mohr has not  forgotten what it was like as a rookie and aids other carvers with insightful  instruction and imparts humorous anecdotes that inspire and move them through a  difficult time.  Jeff has a wealth of  knowledge of carving and life in the hard knocks world of the artist / business  person. His approach to the art form is not unlike shooting an arrow: “There is  no thought of anything but what is at hand, not the last piece, or the next,  nor the dollar amount, or the stares of the interested passer by's.  It’s about the moment, focusing, tuning into  hear what that quiet, still, voice is saying, and then the reflection of what  you have accomplished.”</p>

<p><b>"<strong>Spirit Faces</strong>" with </b> <strong>Jason  Stoner,  Fairfield, PA</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/4_Stoner.jpg" width="200" height="266" style="float: left;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;" />As a kid, Jason always had pencil in hand,  drawing animals, dragons, and other things he would imagine.  “Each art class always seemed to help  discover another branch of my true God given talent”, Jason says.   His degree in graphic design led to  creating, constructing and installing vehicle and dimensional signage. But he  found his real artistic passion when his Dad’s gift of a chainsaw quickly went  from firewood to carving.</p>

<p><b>"<strong>How  to Make Your Carvings Come to Life</strong>" with </b> <strong>Mark  Bodsworth, Athol, MA</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/7_Mark_Bodsworth.jpg" width="200" height="293" style="float: left;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;" />Gifted&nbsp;with many artistic  interest and talents, Mark’s strongest&nbsp;desire&nbsp;and&nbsp;passion&nbsp;is  sculpture. He works in many  different styles, sizes and wood types from highly detailed, eye catching  miniatures to larger than life chain saw sculptures.</p>
A background in taxidermy gave Mark knowledge of anatomy, important for  realism. But he says that paying attention to detail and a God given patience  is key&nbsp;to bring to life, and almost give breath, to an otherwise lifeless  sculpture.&nbsp;Mark will try to help you put expression and attitude into your  carvings.

<p><b>"Monumental Carvings" with </b><strong>Brian  Sprague</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/9_Brian_Sprague.jpg" width="200" height="266" style="float: left;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;" />Brian has been carving for over 25 years with no  formal art training but with an innate ability to draw.  When he was in the third grade his teacher  accused him of copying a picture (you know how we did it in the old days, by  laying a piece of paper on top of an image on a backlit, glass platform) and  saying that: “I did it freehand”. She actually called his mother and asked why  he would lie about such a thing.&nbsp; His mom had to set her straight, telling  her that I actually could draw that well and did not need to copy. So I guess I  was lucky enough to have some innate talent.<br />
While using chainsaws  to fell trees and cut firewood, his first exposure to carving was through Charlie  Derby, and early day carver some 30 years ago.  Charlie kindly lent Brian a chainsaw with a carving  bar. He was hooked!<br />
Brian’s artistic style  is realism but also enjoys abstract and stylized carvings.  He replicates iconic symbols and characters  but prefers to exercise his artistic instincts. &nbsp;The physical and creative  aspects of chainsaw carving are Zen-like, a good release of physical and mental  stress, and blend well with his abilities.  He is happy to tackle carvings of any scale  but especially enjoys doing “Big Stuff”.</p>
Brian and his wife, Minnie, have met great people  carving around the country.  Beyond  carving, he is employed in the Oil and Gas industry and is owner of Sprague  Farm and Brew Works. Brain says he chose not to be full time carver for the  mere fact that I like to eat. No carvin’ or starvin’ for him!
