          <br /><br />
          <h2>Additional Insights</h2>
          <p>The Glass Bead Game is a term coined by Herman Hesse, in his book Magister Ludi, the Glass Bead Game, Hesse explains the game as developing out of Musicology and Mathematics into a game woven as a symphony of knowledge and idea. The Glass Bead Game is a metaphor for a tradition of philosophical Cosmology. This philosophical cosmology is an expression of the fundamental system of order existing in the universe. These systems of Cosmology are usually expressed in symbolic forms such as Geometry, Hieroglyphics, Mythology, Harmonics and Astronomy. The Glass Bead Game is the Artistic, Philosophical manipulation of the symbolic form which express these systems of knowledge.<br /><br />
            To introduce the &ldquo;chance&rdquo; into the competition a dice game could be added to win a free score in a category. &nbsp;(who knows??)<br /><br />
            As a new type of contest for all of us and in a new location, there could be some unforeseen changes.&nbsp; We hope to creatively deal will all obstacles.<br /><br />
            Chautauqua is an ideal environment for an adventure in the Arts. Especially this type of event.<br /><br />

While large-scale wood sculpture is her favorite mode of expression, she finds time to work in other materials, too. "I've always been fascinated by nature, its fragile beauty, its relentlessness and its power," she says. "I try to capture some of that, but also have been drawn to the more abstract qualities and ideas that grab my attention. And sometimes a sense of humor sneaks into what I do, too."

                <h3>Michael Long</h3>
                I create art because I sincerely believe that it is my purpose in life. Art provides a channel for me to express myself. I hope that viewers will walk away with thoughts or feelings that will impact their daily lives. My goals are to enjoy my work and to keep using daily reflection to produce it.
                My work comes from within; my emotions dictate the tone of the final piece. I make decisions based on mood and available materials. I deviate from traditional techniques to produce something new for the viewer's eye.
                My current creations evolved from my experiences as a chainsaw artist. I'm attempting to sculpt by using my painting background to create composition and texture in my media rather than sculpting paint on canvas. I strive to develop a new style of art, something that will stand out from the mainstream.
