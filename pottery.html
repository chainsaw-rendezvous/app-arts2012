          <h1>Mud Slide Pottery</h1>
          <p><i>Roly and Geno Boni</i></p>
          <p>
            At Mudslide Pottery we work to produce well crafted stoneware and
            porcelain pottery. Although deeply<br />
            rooted in tradition, our work uniquely conveys our ideas about the
            modern world. We draw inspiration<br />
            from the environment that surrounds us; from the forests we played
            in as children to the modern<br />
            architecture that dominate today's cities. We use motion and gesture
            as a design concept to give our<br />
            work a sense of life. Most of our work is designed and produced to
            be used daily, so function is our<br />
            main concern. We want our pots to work as well as they look. All of
            our work is handmade one piece<br />
            at a time on the potters' wheel and finished without the use of
            molds or factory production techniques.<br />
            Our pots are often altered after being thrown by adding spouts and
            handles. We have designed our<br />
            handles to be comfortable, and our spouts to pour well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the process our pots are fired twice, the first firing is
            done at a lower temperature to temper<br />
            the clay which makes it easier to handle and glaze. After the first
            firing each piece is sanded, wax<br />
            resist is applied to the foot and then glazed. All of the glazes we
            use are formulated and hand-mixed<br />
            by us using various clays, minerals, and metallic oxides. We strive
            to create glazes that are visually<br />
            stimulating. We use streaking, running and layering effects to
            produce mottling, crystal growth and<br />
            color bands within the glaze. After the work is carefully glazed and
            inspected it is loaded into our 32 cu<br />
            ft. down-draft gas kiln. Over a twelve hour period the potter is
            fired to 3250 degrees F in a reduction<br />
            atmosphere. Reduction is a process which starves the chamber of
            oxygen during crucial points in the<br />
            firing. This process is extremely important to the finished look of
            the work and is monitored closely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hope is that the use of our pottery will enrich and bring joy to
            our customers everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            All glazes are lead free and our work can be put in the microwave
            and dishwasher.
