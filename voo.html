          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <h2>The Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous</h2>
          The Ridgway Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous started as a backyard
          gathering of six chainsaw carvers. In 2000, this relatively small
          group of carvers took it to a whole new level, and at the time, we
          thought this was quite a big gathering of carvers. Little did we
          know...
          <br /><br />
          Since then, it has grown to the world's largest event of its kind and
          evolved into a partnership of community and artistic spirit. Each year
          becomes a challenge to do better than the last!
          <br /><br />
          It is an open invitation to all Chainsaw Carvers wishing to attend the
          Rendezvous. It is an opportunity for Carvers to share, sell, market
          and just feel good about who they are and what they do! To be able to
          measure the growth of the industry while moving the art form forward!
          To challenge their abilities and encourage their performance!
          <br /><br />
          This was our intention when we started, and remains so to this day.
          And it is generally accepted that it is this non-competitive setting
          that makes the Rendezvous something truly special.
          <br /><br />
          Yes, the event has come a long way since those early days, (every
          year, we have more and more carvers attending) and we look forward to
          the exciting opportunities and developments that are yet to come.

          <br />
          Â 
          <h2>The Dream</h2>
          "At the very least, we make each other think. At our very best, we
          inspire one another to common heroics and a fresh, inspired look at
          our own creativity and human potential. We carry the responsibility
          for the gift that we have been given. Our expressions in wood reach
          out and in, farther than we imagine. From the twinkle of an old man's
          eye in Japan to the smile of a child in Europe, we touch them with our
          gift. We have more opportunity to express ourselves than any artists
          in history.
          <br /><br />
          Over the past years, The Ridgway Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous has been
          no exception to this endeavor, and we should all be proud of our
          personal accomplishments. Without a doubt, we raise the bar each year
          with the statistics that are generated - hundreds of carvers and tens
          of thousands of dollars raised. The quality and size of the carvings
          goes up each year, and as well, more carvings hit the $1,000+ mark.
          <br /><br />
          Some of our personal adventures will pass unnoticed, but some, not
          many, will be passed down to our descendents in the form of stories
          that may well some day be legends. Our lives are enriched through this
          international gathering and mingling of custom and language. We gain a
          better understanding of history and geography, commerce and currency.
          We establish a wider trust and a vast reservoir of relative
          information. We make friends in foreign lands and far-off states. We
          transcend our limitations and live beyond our dreams.
          <br /><br />
          If anyone can come up with a better solution for life, please, don't
          tell me. I'm very happy living the life of a chainsaw carver."

          <h1>About the 15th Annual Ridgway Chainsaw Carver's Rendezvous</h1>
          <h2>
            Fine art at 12,000 RPM. Ridgway Renezvous: The World's Most Amazing
            Chainsaw Carving Event
          </h2>
          <h3>By Rob Simbeck</h3>
          RIDGWAY, PA--"The chainsaw," says Liz Boni, "will do for art what the
          electric guitar did for music."
          <br /><br />

          To the uninitiated, that might sound like hyperbole, but to the tens
          of thousands who gather in this postcard-pretty section of
          northcentral Pennsylvania each winter, it is a simple statement of
          fact. Chainsaw carving is the revved-up, sawdust-spitting segment of
          the art world, a place where the scent of pine and motor oil are as
          vital as the sculptor's hands and eyes in creating gorgeous works of
          art. Undertaken here before thousands of spectators, it is the
          adrenaline-fueled meeting of performance art and fine art, and Liz and
          her husband Rick are among those in the vanguard of the movement.
          Their passion is inspirational. Their enthusiasm is contagious. And
          their event--The Ridgway Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous--is nothing less
          than the movement's Woodstock.
          <br /><br />

          Each year, 25,000 people flock to this town in the gorgeous highlands
          known as the Pennsylvania Wilds to witness this event, a showcase that
          allows more than 200 chainsaw carvers from all over the world to
          display their talents, mingle with their peers, share and learn new
          techniques, and teach the craft to others. World Champions create
          one-hour "quick carve" sculptures and work on larger, more complex
          pieces of exceptional beauty and complexity throughout the week. There
          is also plenty of music, an auction of chainsaw art, the chance to buy
          large and small pieces from the assembled artists, communal meals,
          live music, and much more.
          <br /><br />

          The Rendezvous, held the last week of February, will feature chainsaw
          carvers from more than a dozen countries and nearly 40 states, and an
          atmosphere that literally "buzzes" with creative energy.
          <br /><br />

          In its size and scope, and in the worldwide attention it draws, it is
          almost beyond the comprehension of its delighted founders, who came up
          with the idea a decade ago, when Liz's husband Rick and his twin
          brother Randy, both chainsaw carvers, invited a few other carvers from
          the region for a weekend get-together.
          <br /><br />

          "There were nine of them altogether," says Liz, "and they had so much
          fun they thought, 'We should do this again. We should show people what
          we do.'"
          <br /><br />

          Spreading the word by internet helped attract 35 carvers, including
          one from England and one from Germany, to the first official
          Rendezvous, in 1999. The Boni's told the carvers, "If you can get
          here, we'll take care of you." That's still the case today, with many
          in the community offering spare rooms, hunting camps and church
          rectories as sleeping quarters, and cooking meals for the carvers.
          <br /><br />

          Almost at once the Rendezvous began attracting the media, which was
          effusive in its praise of what Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Gene
          Collier called "the delicious quirkiness of it all."
          <br /><br />

          Once the first year was history, stories in the Associated Press, The
          Washington Post, CBS, ESPN. The History Channel, CBS The Early Show
          where Julie Chen actually came and carved, along with many other
          outlets helped draw bigger crowds every year. In fact, the event has
          changed locations three times to accommodate ever-larger crowds.
          <br /><br />

          Carvers are drawn by the fact that the Rendezvous is cooperative
          rather than competitive, and by the straightforward integrity of the
          vision the Boni's have always had for the event.
          <br /><br />

          "When I got an e-mail from Randy," says Rodney Holland, a Scottish
          carver, "I could tell it was from the heart. Here there's no
          competition. Nobody wins anything. Nobody gets a dime. And then when I
          found out it raised money for [charity], I was persuaded."
          <br /><br />

          Rick and Randy had been carving for years before they helped launch
          the Rendezvous, and Liz found she had a knack for spreading the word.
          She and Rick are the owners of Appalachian Arts Studio, a hands-on
          learning facility offering classes in wood carving and pottery, an
          old-style print shop and dark room facility, and a gallery/museum
          dedicated to the history and growth of the art of chainsaw sculpture.
          Their daughter Zoe has also earned a name as a top carver, one of many
          women who excel at the art form.
          <br /><br />

          Rick and Liz have traveled the world, teaching and demonstrating
          carving in Europe and Asia as well as throughout the U.S., and it's
          obvious that they have found nothing less than a calling.
          <br /><br />

          "If someone had told me 15 years ago," says Liz, "that I'd be
          traveling around the world with Rick doing this, I never would have
          believed it."
          <br /><br />

          She has become a believer, and has made believers out of the tens of
          thousands who flock to Ridgway each year, and who will be coming back
          again in February. She says, "To see the excitement, the pure energy
          that's everywhere in this town while the carvers and spectators are
          here--well, trust me, you don't want to miss it."
          <br />

          brings movement and action to the wood. Many are inspired and
          motivated by his abilities with the chainsaw. Again, the bar is being
          raised.

          are met by Brett, who greets them and takes them to his home. He then
          finds a way to get all of them here for the event. Not to mention that
          Brett is an incredible artist. That being said, he is always thinking
          outside the box and truly inspires other to do so through his unique
          approach to chainsaw art.

          Jeff Samudosky â Incredible talent. We misspelled his name or it
          somehow got omitted on the T-shirt just about every year. In 2002, he
          was the first to bring scaffolding to the event. That action alone
          raised the bar. His carvings consistently brought in top dollar at the
          auction, continuing to raise the bar.

          In 2009 KB Pictures/Photography came to the Rendezvous and realized
          what a photo op it was. Their team visited carvers at their studios
          throughout the year. When we saw this picture of Dayton and Michelle
          Scoggins, we knew it would go on the T-shirt. Dayton Scoggins was
          winning competitions in England, Germany and the West Coast. He took
          wildlife carvings to the next level.

          Judy from Washington State and part of the Backus /McVay family of

          on the T-shirt The Rendezvous has grown from a 3 day event into a 10
          day event. Seminars were provided throughout the week, and carvers got
          to spend quality time with each other.

          <h2>2002 â Fireman's Grounds, North Broad Street, Ridgway</h2>
          We were invited by the community to move the Rendezvous to town and
          the "Ridgway Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous" was born and Ridgway was
          proclaimed " 103 carvers came to the Rendezvous. Wayne DeMoranville
          was bringing ice carving to the event. He was also our first featured
          artist on the T-Shirt. Since 2002 we have dedicated the t-shirt to
          carvers who have contributed to the art form and the Rendezvous
          throughout the year.

          <h2>2001- Mid Winter Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous</h2>
          <h3>2nd year at Sandy Beach State Park</h3>
          58 carvers showed up, along with a huge crowd of spectators. We met so
          many new carvers. In April, thanks to Joe King, the Carving Post was
          born. This was an internet forum where carvers were able to post
          pictures and keep in touch; this created an avalanche in the chainsaw
          carving world.<br /><br />

          <h2>2000 Mid-Winter Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous</h2>
          Held at Sandy Beach Park about 3 miles outside of Ridgway. Winter
          boredom and the internet sparked an idea to see how many carvers were
          out there and would they be willing to come together to carve. 33
          carvers came, 2 of whom were international. We thought that was
          incredible. The article about it in our local paper went viral on the
          Associated Press News Wire (AP) - funny viral was not a term back
          then. Holger Baer from Germany and Judy Pratt, NY, both started a web
          sites about the Rendezvous.
